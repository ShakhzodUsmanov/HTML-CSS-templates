# Project Title

## Description

This project aims to develop a high-performance analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for various applications. The ADC will provide accurate and reliable conversion of analog signals into digital data. The project involves hardware design, firmware development, and testing.

## Features

- High-speed and high-resolution ADC
- Low power consumption
- Multiple input channels
- Configurable sampling rate
- Digital output interface
- Error correction and calibration

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/analogue-converter.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd analogue-converter`
3. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`
4. Build the project: `npm run build`
5. Run the project: `npm start`

## Usage

1. Connect the analog signal source to the input channels of the ADC.
2. Configure the desired sampling rate and other settings.
3. Start the ADC conversion process.
4. Retrieve the digital data from the output interface for further processing.
